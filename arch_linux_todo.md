_Consider configuring uwsm._

Configure notifications

THE PLAN:

```
On reboot waybar's icons are grey, but when I toggle the theme once they are forever white.

If I first hold alt and press shift, the keyboard layout changes. But if I first hold shift and press alt, it changes but I can't continue typing unless I regain focus. In VS Code. Probably because Alt+Shift is a keybind in VS Code.
